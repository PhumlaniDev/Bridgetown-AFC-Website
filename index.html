                <p class="text-center" style="color: #000;">In the 1980's there was a team by the name of Crusaders that
                    was based in
                    Bridgetown. This team is
                    the
                    reason why Bridgetown AFC exists today. During their playing days, Crusaders had very good players
                    from
                    all over Athlone. However due to internal conflict and clash of egos, the team decided to split up.
                    Half
                    of the team formed what is known today as Chelsea Bridgetown FC and the other half formed Bridgetown
                    United, which later became Bridgetown Association Football Club. The people that started the club
                    are
                    not in charge anymore however their are a few families that played a major role in the establishment
                    of
                    Bridgetown AFC. The families in particular are the Awaldiens, the Kamaldiens and the Reiners family.
                    Bridgetown AFC had some very talented players over the years, like Riyaaz Hopkins, who represented
                    WP as
                    well as South Africa u21. Bridgetown AFC is a proud football association that stands as a pillar of
                    strength in the Bridgetown community and has kept kids engaged in sport and promotes physical well
                    being
